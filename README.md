# Myseum

## Overview

There is nothing more devastating to an artist than writer's block.

Myseum is a web application created precisely to solve this probem.  With the click of a button, the world of publicly available art is at your fingertips!  Just type in a search query at the bottom, hit Go, and see where your search takes you.  Once you've found the images that inspire you, hit the Save button to save them for later in your own personal gallery.

# Features

When the user arrives at the landing page, they are greeted by an empty canvas and an intuitive search bar at the bottom.  Once they have typed what they would like to search, all they have to do is hit Go and the world of publicly available art is opened to them!

Once they find a painting they like, they are just one tap of the Save button away from adding the painting to their collection.  Once the user is happy with the gallery of saved paintings they've created, they can tap the View Saved Paintings button to see all of the inspiration they've found in their current viewing session.

# Future Additions

While this application is the simple MVP version of the project, one day I would like to add the ability to modify the paintings in the app using online art tools.  This would allow the user to seamlessly combine their inspiration with their own creativity!
